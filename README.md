## Description
- I built a  Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee.
- With this application I also wrote unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it passes all of those tests. 

## Visuals
- 

## Installation
- You will need to do type in the following commands in your terminal:
- npm init -y
- npm i
- npm install jest -D

## Usage
- To start off you will do the following installations in your vs code terminal: npm init -y, npm i, and then npm install jest -D.
- After doing the installations you will start running the program by running the command: node index.js
- You will be prompted by a series of questions that you will need to answer. These questions will be what fills in the information on the employees that will display on their own individual cards in the html.
- Once you successfully make it through the prompts you will be met with the message "Success!"
- The html will be generated with all the information on the individual employees on their own individual cards.
